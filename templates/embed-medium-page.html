                    <p>Designing an interactive sustainability campaign to encourage environmentally-friendly habits among students at HKUST</p>

                    <h2 id="backgroundandgoals">Background and Goals</h2>

                    <p>As a transfer student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in fall 2019, I took an introductory course in human-computer interaction.</p>

                    <p>Our first project was to create a “meaningful” interactive campaign to encourage sustainability on our campus. We were challenged to use the design process to come up with creative solutions beyond the posters and advertisements we
                        see everyday. Campaigns like the example below tend to be more effective at motivating action and changing user behavior.</p>

                    <p>
                        <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVuWtWZh4oQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
                    </p>

                    <p>Together with 4 other students, I set out to create the best campaign possible over the course of a week. My person goal in the process was to stretch my brainstorming and ideation abilities to develop a campaign that was both implementable
                        and effective.</p>

                    <h3 id="evaluatingexistingsustainabilitycampaigns">Evaluating Existing Sustainability Campaigns</h3>

                    <p>To serve as a benchmark for ideation, my group noted dozens of existing environmentalist efforts on campus. These tend to naturally fall into categories based on resource:</p>

                    <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6048/1*6Fo125GvoGloaMU0p1opcA.jpeg" alt="A sample plastic-reduction campaign I documented in Starbucks" /><em>A sample plastic-reduction campaign I documented in Starbucks</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Paper:</strong> Recycling bins; “Say no to disposables” campaigns</p>

                    <p><strong>Waste:</strong> Trash classification guides; added costs for takeout packaging</p>

                    <p><strong>Clothes:</strong> Donation boxes</p>

                    <p><strong>Electricity:</strong> Auto-energy conservation in escalators and library lights; Higher costs for A/C usage in dorms</p>

                    <p><strong>Water:</strong> Automatic tap current limits</p>

                    <p><strong>Plastics:</strong> Straw-free dining areas</p>

                    <p><strong>Food:</strong> Rewards for reducing rice consumption</p>

                    <h3 id="buildingamindmap">Building a Mind-Map</h3>

                    <p>My group then used the classic mind-map brainstorming technique to further explore campaigns we had seen and brainstorm an initial set of tangential solutions. In the process, I discussed with my partners where existing efforts fall
                        short and how better to engage students on campus.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7554/1*S0KPrvmCPb32l3Sycg62Uw.jpeg" alt="A mind-map, separating sustainability campaigns by the issue tackled" /><em>A mind-map, separating sustainability campaigns by the issue tackled</em></p>

                    <h3 id="buildingpovs">Building POVs</h3>

                    <p>Before moving forward, we found it essential to define our user: a typical, busy college student. Our user persona revealed that our campaign needed to be unobtrusive, so that even a distracted and over-extended student could engage
                        with it without too much effort.</p>

                    <p>More specifically, we realized that students receive very little information that allows them to track their sustainability goals. Although many younger people desire to help the environment, they may be unaware of their own footprint
                        or resource consumption. Many of our initial ideas set out to tackle this gap in existing offerings.</p>

                    <h3 id="brainstormingwithmetaphoraction">Brainstorming with Metaphoraction</h3>

                    <p>Having evaluated the status quo and identified a user, my group began to brainstorm creative alternatives. Our first step was to use a tool developed at HKUST called Metaphoraction: its goal is to associate words with each other to
                        generate ideas for meaningful interactions.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2464/1*9MRsKezTKd5lsxHyAbTfmg.png" alt="An example of Metaphoraction’s output when the goal is to invoke feelings of achievement" /><em>An example of Metaphoraction’s output when the goal is to invoke feelings of achievement</em></p>

                    <p>The exercise gave me tons of ideas for device-based interactions, from flips to turns to swipes. These naturally led into a variety of campaign ideas.</p>

                    <h3 id="initialstoryboards">Initial Storyboards</h3>

                    <p>My group came up with several preliminary ideas based on the interactions we brainstormed through Metaphoraction. We represented each through a detailed storyboard highlighting the key features and intended use cases.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3358/1*QxsRWqazoyr-J0qmcwInJg.png" alt="My preliminary idea for a virtual pet: limit electricity usage to keep your pet healthy and alive!" /><em>My preliminary idea for a virtual pet: limit electricity usage to keep your pet healthy and alive!</em></p>

                    <p>The ideas included:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Virtual pet:</strong> A digital creatures that thrives or is gets harmed based on the energy usage of a given dorm or building. This encourages students to be mindful of their usage of light or A/C as they become invested
                                in their animal.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Recycling visualization:</strong> Screens behind recycling bins to show the impact of recycling. Each time a student recycled an item, the screen would show a visual of a forest regrowing, or an item that was able to
                                be produced thanks to their contribution.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Trash sorting feedback:</strong> Indicators on recycling and trash bins to notify students when they input an incorrect item. When a student throws out an item that could have been recycling, this system can notify
                                them through flashing lights and clear feedback system, letting them learn from their mistake.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Sustainability tracker:</strong> A digital app to allow users to view analytics about their resource consumption. Students could scan QR codes around campus — near trash cans, showers, and toilets — to mark their usage
                                and help them understand their own footprint.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 id="userverification">User Verification</h2>

                    <h3 id="speeddating">Speed Dating</h3>

                    <p>With several ideas and storyboards in hand, we went through a “speed dating” process, interacting with several real users to identify the flaws and highlights of our designs. This produced a few takeaways:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Users value direct feedback about their actions.</em> The recycling visualization, while cute, didn’t provide users with any actionable information or push.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><em>Users interact with products in unexpected ways.</em> Though we designed our storyboards with certain interactions in mind, users interpreted them very differently. For example, users expected the trash sorting system to
                                tell them where to put trash prior to their using it, rather than after.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><em>Both positive and negative reinforcement can be effective.</em> While some users indicated that they’d be motivated to keep their pet alive, others preferred a more positive message, such as watching a forest grow as they
                                recycled. This showed the diversity of messages users respond to.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><em>Our designs could use more features.</em> Students would want the ability to feed or customize their virtual pet, to see larger animations of the forest growing, to hear audio feedback from trash cans, and to use QR codes
                                in more places.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="selectingthesustainabilitytracker">Selecting the Sustainability Tracker</h3>

                    <p>Evaluating qualitative and quantitative feedback from our speed dating, a clear design choice emerged: the Sustainability Tracker. This idea was rated most consistently across all students we interviewed, and was also the most realistic
                        to implement. It would be relatively simple and effective to offer students the ability to scan QR codes and view their usage. This option also allowed the most chance for growth, with the option to expand QR code locations over
                        time or add new metrics and visualizations.</p>

                    <p>This app would target the key problem we initially identified: students who want to be sustainable have trouble understanding their own habits.</p>

                    <h3 id="inaction">In Action</h3>

                    <p>Our prototype is a paper-based sample application, with each state and screen sliding in and out of a sample phone-screen container. View it in action below:</p>

                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <h3 id="addinginnovativeinteractions">Adding Innovative Interactions</h3>

                    <p>In creating a prototype for our chosen design, we noticed a flaw in our original assumptions. Scanning QR codes all around campus, while quick, was a relatively annoying and meaningless task. As an exercise in HCI, we wanted to enable
                        the users to conduct interactions that elicited more emotion and response from them. So, we created an entirely new gesture-based of recording utility usage.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Lights:</strong> Snap once over the phone to indicate lights on, and again to mark lights off.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Toilet:</strong> Hover your hand over the phone to indicate a flush.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Trash:</strong> Shake the phone to indicate that you threw something out.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Sink:</strong> Rub your hands together over the phone to mark that you used the sink.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Shower:</strong> Draw a halo above your head with the phone to indicate the start of the shower, and again to mark the end.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This system offered a few key benefits over the previous. First, it required no upfront work to place QR codes around the school; students could immediately begin reporting and tracking their data. Second, it mimicked the resource-consuming
                        actions themselves, allowing students to internalize and reflect more on their usage of utilities.</p>

                    <h3 id="otherfeatures">Other Features</h3>

                    <p>In addition to a novel interaction system, we worked a data analytics and visualization system into our app prototype. The app features:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Home screen for general overview of personal utility usage</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Detailed analytics on each type of utility</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Week-by-week comparison and history</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Interaction guide/manual</p>

                    <p>Returning to users with our prototype video, we received a lot of positive feedback, as well as some ideas for future iterations.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><em>Simplify and improve on interactions.</em> Though the interactions are unique, they’re only as useful as they are practical and simple for students to do and remember. Some, such as the shower motion, could be improved
                                upon to require less work from the user. For example, we could track the time since the last phone pickup to automatically detect the length of the shower.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><em>Add urgency to the tracking.</em> Some students indicated that they’d feel unmotivated to track their sustainability through our app. In the future, we may gamify the experience by turning it into a contest between halls
                                or offering rewards for downloading the app and meeting sustainable goals.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Mind-mapping:</strong> This was an incredibly useful tool for me to compartmentalize and organize my existing thoughts about campaigns. Whereas I’d normally jump between ideas at random, building a flowchart-style map
                                forced me to consider different categories and resulted in new branches I didn’t expect.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Storyboarding:</strong> This design spring taught me the technique of storyboarding and the value of mapping our user interactions during the ideation phase. I learned how to consider use cases and succinctly represent
                                them through a few visuals/scenes.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Physical Prototyping:</strong> Building a paper-based model of an idea is a quick and effective way to try a product with real users. Validating an idea in person with a tangible product allows the users to better imagine
                                how the product would work, and also forced the designer to consider all elements of the physical interaction and states.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Ideating requires varied tools and continuous revision.</strong> Coming up with an idea was ultimately much harder than it seemed at first. It was only through a combination of surveying existing campaigns, mind-mapping,
                                online research, and Metaphoraction that I was able to come up with a handful of unique and innovative ideas.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Listen to users.</strong> Ultimately, it’s important to keep your target persona and POV in mind when designing a product or interaction. Putting aside personal biases, it’s key to choose a course of action that users
                                are most likely to resonate with and one that is supported qualitatively and quantitatively through interviews. Whereas I was initially drawn to my virtual pet idea, our peers resonated more with the sustainability tracker,
                                and it was important for me to listen to the end user.</p>
